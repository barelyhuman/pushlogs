        <small>A Simple CLI tool to log workouts</small>
    </p>
</p>

### Motivation

Well, I log my workouts in my brain and as expected, I forget what my max rep was when I last worked out, so this.

### Contribution

The tool is very simple at this stage and I wouldn't mind if people sent pull requests to make the code more readable or performant or even addition of features.
